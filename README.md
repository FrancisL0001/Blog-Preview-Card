## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Polished my HTML and CSS based skills for building web apps. Had the opportunity to test and experiment with the box-shadow attribute in building a shadow around my box:

```css
box-shadow: 6px 6px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.991);
```

Finally understood how to position my elements as centered in a vertical sense. Used the "vh" attribute for height:

```css
height: 60vh;
```

Noticed that this gives about 60% of the vertical height available on the screen. Quite nice to use. 


### Continued development

I now look forward to creating real web apps by incorporating js or a framework into my work and perhaps moving to backend eventually.
